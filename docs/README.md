# BinDiff Documentation

BinDiff is a leading executable-comparison tool for reverse engineers that need
to analyze patches, malware variants, or are generally interested in the
differences between two executables.

In order to make best use of BinDiff, it is very helpful to spend a bit of time
familiarizing yourself with the concepts and algorithms behind it. For this, we
recommend reading [Understanding BinDiff](concepts.md), which explains the
behind-the-scenes and
[Core Functionality](https://www.zynamics.com/bindiff/manual/#chapCoreFunc),
which explains the basic elements of the user interface.

Ideally, we would like you to also read
[Analyzing a Microsoft Patch](https://www.zynamics.com/bindiff/manual/#chapWalkthrough)
(a walk-through demonstrating how to analyze a simple security update) and
[Advanced Usage](https://www.zynamics.com/bindiff/manual/#N20AB6)
(porting your symbols and comments from one disassembly to the next).

*This documentation is a work in progress and not everything from the original
manual has been ported over.*
